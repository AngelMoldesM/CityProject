            <h2>Rosalía de Castro</h2>
            <p>Rosalía de Castro was a Galician poet, strongly identified with her native Galicia and the celebration of the Galician language. Writing in Galician and Spanish, after the period known as the Séculos Escuros, she became an important figure of the Galician Romantic movement, known today as the Rexurdimento, along with Manuel Curros Enríquez and Eduardo Pondal. Her poetry is marked by saudade, an almost ineffable combination of nostalgia, longing and melancholy.</p>
