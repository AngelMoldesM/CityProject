                <p>This famous pilgrimage site in north-west Spain became a symbol in the Spanish Christians' struggle against Islam. Destroyed by the Muslims at the end of the 10th century, it was completely rebuilt in the following century. With its Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque buildings, the Old Town of Santiago is one of the world's most beautiful urban areas.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In the beginning of the 9th century, a hermit called Pelagius saw a mysterious light shining over a Roman tomb forgotten in the middle of a forest. Very soon, the incredible news spread all over the Christian world: the tomb of St. James the Greater, the beloved apostle of Jesus Christ, had been discovered in a far site near the finis terrae, the end of the known Earth, in the northwest of Iberian Peninsula. A few years later, this site became a famous pilgrimage town, one of the most important of Christianity. Pilgrims came from all over Europe following the Camino de Santiago to reach the city born around the Holy Tomb, exercising a great influence on the surrounding area.</p>

            <h2>Legends</h2>
            <p>In the legends of the origin of Santiago de Compostela, there are four important characters. One, obviously, is Santiago the Apostle. The other two are the disciples who moved the remains from Israel. The fourth character is Queen Lupa. This monarch, also known as Queen Lopa, Queen Luca, Queen Luparia, Queen Wolf, given her malicious character, designed various tricks to prevent the apostle from being buried in Galician lands. All of them ended with miraculous facts that gave rise to various legends of the Camino de Santiago that we know today</p>
